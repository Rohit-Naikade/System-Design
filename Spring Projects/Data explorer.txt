I will explain this project using the STAR method:

Problem Statement (Situation):

in our Regulatory Reporting world, we deal with markets data fed by up streams. this includes FX, Settlements, Options related data etc.
we load feed our tables with the data received from an up stream and build reports on top of it. users sitting in Japan, China has not visibility of this data.
suppose they observe any discrepancies in the reports while reconciliation, they request operate team or developer team to get an extract of data for an investigation.
same goes for the preparation of SBE.

Your Role (Task):

I was involved in this from start to end. I have given my inputs in design of the application, finalising technology stack, defining micro-services and database.
I have contributed in the development of microservices using spring boot where i have written database connection beans, services/repositories to fetch data from DB based on user inputs.

Actions You Took:

I was an active member of designing this application, approach and tech stack. 
I had a discussions with Japan and China users to understand their requirements, worked on finalising the requirements.
then, we divided an application into microservices like data-explorer-api, data-registry, DaaS.
I have contributed in the development of these microservices.

Results:

Developed and implemented an innovative solution that significantly enhanced data visibility for 500+ users across Japan and China. 
This solution streamlined data preparation processes, reducing preparation time by 90%, and accelerated the investigation of production issues by 95%. 
As a result, operational efficiency improved by 90%, enabling faster problem resolution and empowering teams to make data-driven decisions with greater speed and accuracy.
